## What I Have Learned
I have learned how to utilize SQL databases within the application, </br>
as a test of configuring queries and creating tables. </br>
Taking forth previous knowledge of express.js, node.js, and inquirer, </br>
and combining it with new SQL definitions has expanded my mind </br>
on what it means to be a developer. </br>
