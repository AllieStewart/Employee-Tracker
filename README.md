## Description
Challenge 12 coursework for UT bootcamp. Uses Node.js, Express.js, Inquirer, and SQL. </br>
This program runs in the command line, taking input from the user in regards to </br>
an employee database, with three tables - department, role, and employee. </br>
The user can select from a menu, if they wish to view all departments, roles, and employees, </br>
if they wish to add a department, role, or employee, and if they wish to update an employee's role. </br>
They can exit the program by selecting 'Quit'. </br>

## What I Have Learned
I have learned how to utilize SQL databases within the application, </br>
as a test of configuring queries and creating tables. </br>
Taking forth previous knowledge of express.js, node.js, and inquirer, </br>
and combining it with new SQL definitions has expanded my mind </br>
on what it means to be a developer. </br>
